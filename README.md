0x11. C - printf

This project is a simple implementation of the 'printf' function in the C programming language. The printf function is used to create and output strings that are formatted at runtime. These functions enable programmers to create a string which is based on a format string and a variable number of arguments. It enables programmers to display information on the console or write it to a file.

The purpose of this project is to understand how the 'printf' function works and it's a group project which enables programmers to collaborate on a project.
